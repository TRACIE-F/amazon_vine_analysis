# Amazon Vine Analysis #

## Overview ##
In this analysis, I chose to analyze Amazon reviews of musical instruments. This analysis looks for potential bias for paid reviews versus non-paid reviews based on 5 star reviews and their tendencies in a paid or non-paid audience.

## Results ##
Using the code below, 

  * Total Vine Reviews: 60
  * Total Non-Vine Reviews: 14,447
  * 5 Star Vine Reviews: 34
  * 5 Star Non-Vine Reviews: 8,212
  * Percent of 5 Star Vine reviews: 56.66%
  * Percent of 5 Star Non-Vine reviews: 56.72%

## Summary ##
Within the musical instrument review, I do not see any significant bias for Vine reviews or non-Vine reviews based on this analsysis. The percent of overall 5 star reviews are 57% (rounded) for both Vine and non-Vine reviews.

There are two categories that might deepen this analysis: marketplace and verified_purchase. Reviewing the countries could possibly provide some additional insight, while reviewing verified purchases could also demonstrate patterns. With the number of non-Vine purchases being so much greater than the Vine purchaes, I would like to eliminate un-verified purchases and see if the percentages are still close.
